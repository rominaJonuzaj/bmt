//               This Agreement governs your use of Inspire11’s mobile application (“Services”), through which you can
//               access content and other in-app services (collectively, “Content”). Content may be offered through the
//               Services by Inspire11 or a third party. Our Services are available for your use in your country or
//               territory of residence (“Home Country”). By creating an account for use of the Services in a particular
//               country or territory you are specifying it as your Home Country. To use our Services, you need compatible
//               hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required), and internet access (fees may
//               apply). Our Services’ performance may be affected by these factors.

//               Your download, installation or use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of this Agreement, which
//               takes effect on the date on which you download, install, or use the Services. If you do not agree with

//             <Text style={styles.subHeader}>a. Payment, Taxes & Refunds</Text>
//             <Text style={styles.text}>
//               There is no fee to use our Services. You can acquire Content on our Services through what is referred to
//               as a “Transaction.” Each Transaction is an electronic contract between you and Inspire11, and/or you and
//               the entity providing the Content on our Services. When you make your first Transaction, we will ask you to
//               choose how frequently we should ask for your password for future Transactions. If you enable Touch ID for
//               Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions with your fingerprint, and if you enable
//               Face ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions using facial recognition. Your
//               password settings can be managed at any time in the Inspire11 mobile app. Inspire11 will charge your
//               selected payment method (such as your credit card, debit card, gift card/code, or other method available
//               in your Home Country) for any paid Transactions, including any applicable taxes. If we cannot charge your
//               selected payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you remain responsible
//               for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method again as you may update your
//               payment method information. If you pre-order Content, you will be charged when the Content is delivered to
//               you unless you cancel before the Content becomes available. In accordance with local law, Inspire11 may
//               update information regarding your selected payment method if provided such information by your financial
//               institution. All Transactions are final. Content prices may change at any time. If technical problems
//               prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement of
//               the Content or refund of the price paid, as determined by Inspire11. From time to time, Inspire11 may
//               refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipulative behavior that
//               entitles Inspire11 to a corresponding counterclaim.

//             <Text style={styles.text}>
//               Inspire11 may also provide you with the opportunity to donate to a charity or organization highlighted by

//               organization shall also be considered a “Transaction” and shall be subject to the same terms and
//               conditions.

//               current employee, contractor, or subcontractor of Inspire11 access to the Services and/or Content, you
//               violate this Agreement and your access to the Services and/or Content may be revoked.

//             <Text style={styles.text}>
//               Inspire11 believes strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not
//               differ depending on where you live in the world. That’s why we treat any data that relates to an
//               identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Inspire11 as “personal
//               data,” no matter where the individual lives. This means that data that directly identifies you — such as
//               your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably
//               be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is personal data. Aggregated data is
//               considered non-personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy covers how
//               Inspire11 handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through our mobile
//               application, or in person.
//             </Text>
//             <Text style={styles.text}>
//               Please note that Inspire11 may link to third parties on our website or through our mobile application;
//               this Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We
//               encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them.

//             <Text style={styles.text}>
//               At Inspire11, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and
//               delete your personal data. If you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you will not be treated in a
//               discriminatory way nor will you receive a lesser degree of service from Inspire11. Inspire11 does not sell
//               your data.

//             <Text style={styles.text}>
//               To help protect the security of your personal data, if you wish to restrict or delete your personal data,
//               you must first sign into your account and verify your identity. There may be situations where we cannot
//               grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Inspire11 is legally
//               obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request
//               if doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for antifraud and security purposes, such as when
//               you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your
//               privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or
//               would be extremely impractical.

//               Certain features of the Inspire11 website or app may not be available if all cookies are disabled. In
//               addition to cookies, Inspire11 uses other technologies that help us achieve similar objectives. In some
//               email messages Inspire11 sends to you, we provide a “click-through URL” that links you to content on the
//               Inspire11 website or app. When you click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate server before
//               arriving at the destination page. We track this click-through to help us determine interest in particular
//               topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be tracked in
//               this way, you should not click graphic or text links in email messages. Inspire11 generally treats data we
//               collect using these cookies and similar technologies as nonpersonal data. However, to the extent that
//               Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also
//               treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In addition, Inspire11 sometimes combines
//               nonpersonal data collected from these technologies with other personal data Inspire11 holds. When we
//               combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.

//             <Text style={styles.text}>
//               Inspire11 products and offerings connect you to the world. To make that possible, your personal data may

//               of personal data between countries to help ensure your data is protected, wherever it may be. The
//               Inspire11 entity that controls your personal data may differ depending on where you live. For example, if
//               you are employed in Kosovo, Inspire11 shpk. will control and have access to your personal data. At this
//               time, Inspire11 does not transfer personal data within the European Economic Area, nor in participating
//               Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation countries and therefore, does not comply with either the GPR or APEC

//               would like to submit a complaint, you can contact us at privacy@inspire11.com. You can also ask us
//               questions about how to submit a privacy complaint and we will endeavor to help. Inspire11 takes your
//               privacy questions seriously. A dedicated team reviews your inquiry to determine how best to respond to
//               your question or concern, including those inquiries received in response to an access or download request.
//               In most cases, all substantive contacts receive a response within seven days. In other cases, we may

//               notice at least a week in advance of doing so and contact you directly about the change if we have your
//               data on file.
